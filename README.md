- Named graphs
- database agnostic storage layer
- query engine with SPARQL like features & result serializations as
  CSV & JSON-LD
- Turtle I/O, CSV to RDF conversion utilities
- Simple rulebased inference engine
- graph export as Graphviz
- mapping of RDF graphs as object trees (nested Clojure maps)
